# OpenSteve

## Intro
OpenSteve is a minecraft mod that aimed to add AI entities, Steve and Alex. The AI entities are designed to learn from interacting with the surrounding terrain. The development has not been updated in a while due to the lack of well designed neural network classes and neural architecture. Nevertheless, some of the progress is shown below.
